===========

Made (mostly) with good old-fashioned, hand-crafted HTML and CSS, but I was also looking for an easy way to template certain things like headers/footers so I could update everything easily.

Most of the big static-site-generators (Jekyll, Hugo, etc.) are way overkill for what I was wanting, but then I found [makesite.py](https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite). Simple, no extra fluff, and easy to tweak. A few tweaks to my existing html files and a Github Action to auto-build the site, and I'm good to go.
